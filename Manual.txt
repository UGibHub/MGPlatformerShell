This is a testing playground for a future platformer I'd like to make. 100% experiemental. It is also meant to be used in tandem with another MG project
I am working on, my Tile Editor program. Making tilemaps in that project, and copy/pasting them over to the  World/Levels folder here.

This should work out of the box in it's present state. (Not that there is much to really do yet. My efforts have been focused on the tile editor.)

IF you should want to create a map of your own using my other program (See the repository on my GitHub) you will have to alter the filepath in the Game1.cs
file in this project. On line 66, just rename the filepath to whatever you decide to name your export Json in the tile editor, 
and obviously cut/paste it from that project to this one.

Sidenote I set this up for my 1920/1080 resolution laptop. Your mileage may vary, (I code/game on a toaster by todays standards.)
